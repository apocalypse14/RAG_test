1) https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/markdown_header_metadata_splitter/#:
~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%20markdown%20file,a%20specified%20set%20of%20headers.

2) https://api.python.langchain.com/en/v0.1/langchain_api_reference.html#module-langchain.chains

3) https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/rag/
